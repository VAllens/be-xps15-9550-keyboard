# Belgian keyboard layout for XPS 15 9550 Hackintosh (CMD as Windows key)

This is a juste a simple keayboard layout if the standard apple one doesn't suit you and if you don't want to mess with a key remapper.

After couples weeks of testing I can assure you that it feels good as the native windows layout. Every key is mapped correctly. Feel free to fork and to make any adjustements.
